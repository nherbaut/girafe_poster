   Demonstration of the \underline{CDN-as-a-VNF model}.

2 virtual functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item vCDN : virtual CDN (delivery phase)
\item vMG : virtual Media Gateway (request phase)	
\end{itemize}


chained together \& optimally embedded inside the ISP topology $\rightarrow$ in order to respect the CDN-ISP collaboration contract (SLA).

This permits to keep ISP topology private while letting the CDN control some low level network capabilities of content delivery.
Our algorithm increased the request acceptance rate by 52\% and decreased the consumed bandwidth by 31\%.

				\item Goal: Instantiate a NFV platform within the ISP Network capable of hosting (vCDN) services
				\item ISP managed NFVI-Point of Presence (POPs) are at the edge of the network, interconnected by physical links and switches that support SDN.
				\item CDN manages a "CDN View" overlay that abstracts the ISP Topology
				\item CDN providers manage CDN operations dynamically through an API e.g. to decide which route to use and react to route congestion.

  \item SLAs are a way to formalize the CDN "demand" for connectivity. ISP responds to the SLA by pricing the connectivity "offer" they supply. 
  \item On top of video-streaming specific input, the SLA contains the User area to be connected as well as the connection to the external CDN network through peering points.

				\begin{itemize}
					
				\item Results show the embedding of a random set of SLAs over the GEANT Topology.
				\item We compare 4 strategies where SLA-derived Service Function Chains (SFC) are modified according to the topology, in order to minimize embedding cost.
				\item we use an ILP formulation to optimize exactly the SFC embedding problem
				\item Our algorithm (VMG+vCDN) performs a 52\% increase in embedding requests, and a 31\% decrease in network utilisation.
				\item As we increase the number of vNF, we have a 3x increased node capacity consumption.
